# Golden Path Demo Service: conventions for AI coding agents

Demo service generated from the DevEx golden path; used to prove the CI gates and produce DORA data. Owned by the **platform** team. Generated from the
[DevEx golden path](https://github.com/RidhanPar/devex-golden-path); read `AI_USAGE.md` for what
you may and may not do.

## Commands (identical names on every OS)

| Task | Linux / macOS / devcontainer | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Install everything | `make setup` | `./dev.ps1 setup` |
| Lint + format check | `make lint` | `./dev.ps1 lint` |
| Auto-fix + format | `make format` | `./dev.ps1 format` |
| Type check | `make typecheck` | `./dev.ps1 typecheck` |
| Tests + coverage | `make test` | `./dev.ps1 test` |
| All of the above | `make check` | `./dev.ps1 check` |
| Run locally | `make run` | `./dev.ps1 run` |

Run `check` before declaring a task finished. A task is not done while `check` fails.

## Layout

- `src/golden_path_demo_service/main.py`: FastAPI app and routes.
- `tests/`: pytest tests, one `test_<module>.py` per module.
- `requirements.txt`: pinned runtime dependencies (the single source of truth; `pyproject.toml` reads it).
- `requirements-dev.txt`: pinned dev tooling.

## Code conventions

- Python 3.13, `src/` layout, absolute imports (`from golden_path_demo_service.x import y`).
- Every function has type annotations; mypy runs in `--strict` mode. No `Any` and no bare
  `# type: ignore`: if one is unavoidable, add the error code and a reason.
- Request and response bodies are Pydantic models, never raw `dict`.
- Ruff decides formatting and import order. Don't hand-format; a hook runs ruff after every edit.
- Configuration comes from environment variables. Variables in use: `LOG_LEVEL`.
  Never hard-code URLs, tokens or credentials.

## Testing conventions

- Test through the public interface: HTTP routes via `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`.
- Every behaviour change ships with a test that fails without the change.
- Coverage must stay at or above 80% (enforced by pytest and CI).
- Never delete or weaken a test to make the suite pass.

## Off-limits

- `.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/`, keys and certificates: reading them is blocked by
  `.claude/settings.json`. Don't try to work around it.
- `git push`: blocked. Humans push and open pull requests.
- Changes to dependencies, `.github/`, `.claude/` or `Dockerfile` need explicit human approval
  (see `AI_USAGE.md`).
