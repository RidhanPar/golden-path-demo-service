# Golden Path Demo Service

Demo service generated from the DevEx golden path; used to prove the CI gates and produce DORA data.

Generated from the [DevEx golden path](https://github.com/RidhanPar/devex-golden-path).
Owner: **platform**.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Python 3.13+ and git. Docker is optional (for `docker-build`).
Or open the folder in VS Code and choose **Reopen in Container**.

```bash
# Linux / macOS
make setup
make check
make run        # http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
./dev.ps1 setup
./dev.ps1 check
./dev.ps1 run   # http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Run `make help` or `./dev.ps1 help` to list all commands.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness probe: `{"status": "ok", "version": "..."}` |
| GET | `/hello?name=Ada` | Greeting |

## Working with AI tools

Read [`AI_USAGE.md`](AI_USAGE.md). Claude Code picks up [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and the
`.claude/` folder automatically: secrets are unreadable, ruff runs after every edit, and
`/review` and `/write-tests` are available as commands.

## Updating from the golden path

```bash
copier update --trust
```

<!-- gate proof control: harmless docs change -->
