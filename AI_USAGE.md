# AI usage policy

This policy applies to every AI coding tool used on **Golden Path Demo Service** (Claude Code, Copilot,
Cursor, ChatGPT and others). The rules for Claude Code are enforced technically by
`.claude/settings.json`; for other tools they are a team agreement checked in code review.

**The principle: the human who merges a change owns it.** AI changes how code is written,
not who is accountable for it.

## 1. What AI agents may do without asking

- Read and edit application code in `src/` and tests in `tests/`.
- Run the standard commands: `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`, `test`, `check`.
- Read git history and diffs.
- Draft commit messages, PR descriptions, docs and ADRs for a human to edit.

## 2. What always needs human review before merge

All AI-assisted changes go through a normal pull request with at least one human approval.
These areas also need the reviewer to explicitly confirm they checked them:

| Area | Why |
|---|---|
| New or upgraded dependencies (`requirements*.txt`) | Supply-chain risk; AI tools have suggested packages that do not exist ("slopsquatting"). |
| CI/CD and repo config (`.github/`, `Dockerfile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`) | Can disable the safety gates for everyone. |
| AI tool config (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, this file) | Changes what the agent is allowed to do. |
| Authentication, authorisation, cryptography | Subtle bugs here are security incidents. |
| Anything handling personal or customer data | Legal and privacy obligations. |
| Database migrations and deletes | Hard to reverse. |

Agents never push, merge, tag releases or deploy. `git push` is denied in `.claude/settings.json`.

## 3. Testing rules

- AI-written code meets the same bar as human code: `check` passes and CI is green.
- Every behaviour change includes a test that fails without the change.
- An agent must never delete, skip or weaken a test to make a build pass. If a test looks
  wrong, the agent stops and asks.
- The reviewer reads the tests first: they are the specification the AI was working to.

## 4. Data and secrets rules

- Never paste secrets, credentials, customer data or personal data into any AI tool,
  chat or prompt, including "just for debugging".
- Agents are blocked from reading `.env`, `.env.*`, `secrets/`, `*.pem`, `*.key`.
  This is defence in depth, not a guarantee: secrets belong in a secrets manager, and
  gitleaks runs in pre-commit and CI.
- Use obviously fake values in tests and examples (`test-token-not-real`).
- Use only AI tools approved by the organisation, on plans where our code is not used
  for model training.
- If a secret is exposed to an AI tool or committed, treat it as leaked: rotate it
  immediately and tell the security owner. Deleting the commit isn't enough.

## 5. Attribution

Mark substantially AI-generated commits with a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the tool, so
that we can measure the effect of AI tooling on quality and speed later.

_Owner: platform team. Review this policy every 6 months or when adopting a new AI tool._
